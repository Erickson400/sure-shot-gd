Godot port of MDickie's game Sure Shot from 2002. 
This port is meant to be an accurate recreation of the original game into a modern engine, mainly to preserve it and allow fans to play with the logics and assets more easily. The old game doesnt run on modern computers either, which a port was crucial to keep it playable. Check out MDickie's mobile remake of the game on app stores; it's free and more feature-rich.
